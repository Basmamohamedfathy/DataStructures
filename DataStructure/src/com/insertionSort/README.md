# Bubble sort
## Steps
### Iterate
```
Visit each item in the array from the start to the end
```
### Swap
```
If two neighboring items are out of order,swap them
```
### Repeat
```
Repeat this process until the array is sorted
```
## time complexity
```
in the average case, the time complexity of the standard bubble sort would be O(N^2).
```
